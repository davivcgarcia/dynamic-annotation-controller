# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dynamic Annotation Scheduler is a Kubernetes controller that automatically manages annotations on Pods and their controllers (StatefulSets, Deployments, DaemonSets) based on configurable time-based scheduling rules. The controller uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define scheduling rules that specify when annotations should be applied or removed from workloads selected by label selectors. The scheduling system supports both ISO datetime format with start/finish times and cron-compatible syntax for recurring operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to define time-based annotation rules for Kubernetes workloads, so that I can automatically apply metadata based on schedules without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an AnnotationScheduleRule CRD THEN the system SHALL validate the rule configuration and store it in the cluster
2. WHEN an AnnotationScheduleRule is created THEN the system SHALL support both ISO datetime format (start/finish) and cron-compatible syntax for scheduling
3. WHEN defining a rule THEN the system SHALL require label selectors to identify target workloads
4. WHEN a rule is created THEN the system SHALL validate that the schedule format is correct and the label selectors are valid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the controller to automatically apply annotations to matching workloads when scheduled times are reached, so that workloads receive the correct metadata at the right time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scheduled time is reached THEN the controller SHALL identify all workloads matching the rule's label selectors
2. WHEN applying annotations THEN the controller SHALL target Pods, StatefulSets, Deployments, and DaemonSets that match the selectors
3. WHEN the start time of an ISO datetime rule is reached THEN the controller SHALL apply the specified annotations to matching resources
4. WHEN a cron schedule triggers THEN the controller SHALL execute the annotation operation according to the cron expression
5. WHEN applying annotations THEN the controller SHALL preserve existing annotations unless explicitly configured to overwrite

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want annotations to be automatically removed when their scheduled end time is reached, so that temporary metadata doesn't persist beyond its intended lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the finish time of an ISO datetime rule is reached THEN the controller SHALL remove the specified annotations from matching resources
2. WHEN removing annotations THEN the controller SHALL only remove annotations that were applied by the same rule
3. WHEN a rule is deleted THEN the controller SHALL remove all annotations that were applied by that rule
4. WHEN removing annotations THEN the controller SHALL not affect annotations applied by other rules or external sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to monitor the status and health of annotation scheduling rules, so that I can ensure the system is operating correctly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rule is processed THEN the controller SHALL update the rule's status with the last execution time and result
2. WHEN errors occur during rule processing THEN the controller SHALL record error messages in the rule's status
3. WHEN a rule successfully applies or removes annotations THEN the controller SHALL log the operation with details of affected resources
4. WHEN the controller starts THEN it SHALL reconcile existing rules and update their status appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the controller to handle edge cases and failures gracefully, so that the system remains stable and reliable in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a target resource is deleted THEN the controller SHALL handle the deletion gracefully without errors
2. WHEN the controller restarts THEN it SHALL resume monitoring all existing rules without losing state
3. WHEN network or API server issues occur THEN the controller SHALL retry operations with exponential backoff
4. WHEN invalid schedule formats are detected THEN the controller SHALL reject the rule and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN label selectors match no resources THEN the controller SHALL log this condition but not treat it as an error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to configure multiple annotation operations within a single rule, so that I can manage related annotations together efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a rule THEN the system SHALL support specifying multiple key-value annotation pairs
2. WHEN a rule triggers THEN the controller SHALL apply or remove all specified annotations atomically
3. WHEN configuring annotations THEN the system SHALL support both static values and templated values with basic variable substitution
4. WHEN annotation conflicts occur THEN the controller SHALL follow a defined precedence order and log the resolution
